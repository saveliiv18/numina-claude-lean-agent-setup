An agent built on Claude Code for formal theorem proving tasks. We used this system to prove all 12 problems from Putnam 2025, and completed a paper-level formalization of [Effective Brascamp-Lieb inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11091).

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Run the following command to set up Lean, Claude Code, and the local CLI skills (code-transform, llm, search, sorrifier, verification):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/project-numina/numina-lean-agent
cd numina-lean-agent/tutorial
./setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```


If you prefer a manual installation or encounter any issues with the automatic script, please refer to the **[Tutorial: Setup Guide](tutorial/setup.md)** for detailed step-by-step instructions.

Next, set up the Python environment:
```bash
cd ..
uv python install
uv sync
```


Before running any scripts, activate the Python environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run Our Agent

After following the setup instructions, your project will be located at `projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`. Place your Lean code here and start experimenting!

> **Note:** The target `.lean` file or folder you pass to `run` / `batch` / `from-folder` must live **inside a Lean project** (an ancestor directory contains `lean-toolchain` and `lakefile.{lean,toml}`). The CLI skills walk up from the target to find the project root and invoke `lake env lean` there — a standalone `.lean` file outside any project will fail to compile.

#### Quick Examples

Before running the examples, you need to configure Claude Code. Choose one of the following options:

- **Option 1: Claude Account Login**  
  Run `Claude` in the terminal and follow the interactive login instructions.

- **Option 2: API Key Configuration**  
  Set the following environment variables with your API credentials:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=xxx      # Optional: custom API endpoint
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx    # Your API key
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=xxx         # Model name (e.g., claude-opus-4-7)
```

#### Skill API Keys

The CLI skills under `skills/cli/` call external services and need their own credentials. These are **separate from Claude's auth above** — the agent will fail at the corresponding skill invocation if they are missing.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx          # Required: discussion_partner, informal_prover (gemini), code_golf
export LEANEXPLORE_API_KEY=xxx     # Required: leanexplore (semantic Mathlib search)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx          # Required only if you use informal_prover / discussion_partner with the gpt backend
export AXLE_API_KEY=xxx            # Required only for axle commands (verify-proof, disprove, sorry2lemma, ...)
```

Once configured, the quickest way to try it out is:

```bash
bash ./example_run.sh [target_folder]
```

This runs `from-folder` with the autosearch coordinator prompt, a timestamped `--result-dir`, `--max-rounds 10`, and the `REFERENCE_RESOURCES` env var pre-set. Edit the script to tweak defaults or switch between `run` / `batch` / `from-folder`.

Per-task outputs (including an isolated `cli.log`, `cli_stats.json`, per-round JSON, and the raw Claude stream) land under `results/<run_id>/<task_id>/`. See the [Usage Guide](tutorial/usage.md#output) for the full layout.
